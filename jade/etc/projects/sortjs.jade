      |  I wrote Sort.js as a way to bridge the gap between concepts taught in computer science and practical use of JavaScript, and at the same time deepen my understanding of both. I suspect many learning JavaScript come from a similar academic background as me, with most classes using C++ or Java. With Sort.js, I aim to illustrate common programming tasks using JavaScript idioms and patterns.

      |  So far, I have implemented Mergesort and Bubblesort, and created a visual demo for Mergesort. I hope to add visualizations and implementations for the following:
    ul.bullet
      li Bucket Sort
      li Heap Sort
      li Insertion Sort
      li Quicksort

      |  I plan to move this to Github soon, but for now you can see a demo
      a(href='/files/sortjs/demo.html') here
      |  .

      |  In the future, I would also like to write implementations for the following graph analysis algorithms:
    ul.bullet
      li Floydâ€“Warshall shortest path algorithm
      li Dijkstra's algorithm for single-source shortest paths
